///
/// Initialy, all cards were not shown, big card is empty and ads was not watched
///
/// ---
///
/// **If user clicked on some card, you must send it's type to the setter "choise"**
///
/// If condition "dont show ads" is true, then this card type marked as true
/// inside "cardShown" map,
///
/// if not - it will mark boolean toBuildAds as true
///
/// in both paths field "_choise" will save card type that was just sent
///
/// ---
///
/// **after ads watched (if needed), you need to call "whenAdsWatched()"**
///
/// it will mark "adsWatched" as true and "toBuildAds" as false
///
/// also it will mark current "_choise" as true
/// inside "cardShown" map,
