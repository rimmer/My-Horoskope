    /// And mostly, they just figure out something "on their own"
    /// that had no any connection with astrology.
    /// That was very disappointing.
    ///
    /// But I heard from two peoples that they used "Calesial Tarot"
    /// Tarot is a cards deck, that came from jewish Kabbalah
    /// And later on was redone in many formats, from an popular
    /// card game "Joker"/"Fool" till the use in many ezoterics practices
    /// "Calesial" tarot was done for astrologic purpose.
    /// Exactly what we needed. And you will understand why.
    /// I actually buyed one deck of "Calesial Tarot", nice art work.
    ///
    /// About this part of algorithm:
    /// I used days modulus from previous "Chaotic" idea
    /// But with modulus 56, 78 and 22.
    ///
    /// Calesial tarot has 78 cards
    /// First 22 cards called major arcana
    /// Every card represents astrologic sign
    /// Or planet is Solar system
    ///
    /// Next 56 cards divided in groups by 14 cards
    /// Wands (Fire), Pentactles (Earth), Swords(Air) and Cups(Water)
    /// Arts on them represents stories from Roman/Greek mythology
    /// But last 3 arts in every group also represent astrologic signs.
    /// More of it, every group has an element that represents group of
    /// astrologic signs. And even last 3 cards has names of its element.
    /// For example, "King of Wands" is called "Cardinal Fire"
    /// which is "Aries" in astrology
    ///
    ///
    /// How can we use it in our algorithm?
    /// We have 78 cards, half of these cards are connected
    /// to the astrologic signs
    /// And all 78 cards connected to the elements of the astrologic signs.
    ///
    /// We will do modulus %56, %78, %22
    /// On days that person lived
    ///
    /// In modulus %56
    /// In one day from 56s (probability )
    /// User will get the card that represents its astrologic sign
    ///
